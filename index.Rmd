This is the website of the Neurolinguistics group at the University of Zurich, headed by Prof. Alexis Hervais-Adelman. 
Have a look at our [ongoing projects](Projects.html), any job and internship [opportunities](Vacancies.html) and [publications](Publications.html).


## About Us
The neurolingusitics group focuses on the neural basis of language using a variety of methodological approaches to answer the very big question of "how does language work?". 
We employ MRI, M/EEG, non-invasive electrical brain stimulation, and neurofeedback to look at how the brain processes speech and text.
We examine the mechanisms that allow us to [comprehend speech in noise or other acoustically challenging speech](Projects.html#audio-motor-integration).
One of the key questions we are interested in is the [role of the motor system in speech perception](Projects.html#audio-motor-integration) and how we might be able to leverage this system to improve speech comprehensions for individuals with hearing impairments.
We explore pre-natal language development and [how our experiences in the womb affect our speech system](Projects.html#in-utero-vocal-learning), a vital piece of the puzzle in how humans evolved spoken language.
