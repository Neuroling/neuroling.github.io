## Project 1

Last compiled: `r Sys.Date()`

This will be a project description. In here we can also include demos and interactive elements.

### Interactive Plots

We can include basic interactive plots easy to make with plotly. We can also create a ggplot and plotlyfy it, making it interactive:

```{r, out.width=300, out.height=300}
p <- ggplot(fortify(forecast::gold), aes(x, y)) + geom_line()
p <- ggplotly(p)
p <- p %>% layout(dragmode = "pan")
p

```

We can include different types of interactive tables and plots (html widgets)

```{r, out.height=200, out.width=200}
library(dygraphs)
dygraph(nhtemp, main = "") %>% 
dyRangeSelector(dateWindow = c("1920-01-01", "1960-01-01"))

```

There are packages available for specific interactive plots

```{r, out.height=400, out.width=400}
library(threejs)
z <- seq(-10, 10, 0.01)
x <- cos(z)
y <- sin(z)
scatterplot3js(x,y,z, color=rainbow(length(z)))

```

### Animations

We can include simple animations , very easy to make with plotly

```{r, out.height=600, out.width=600}
library(plotly)

accumulate_by <- function(dat, var) {
  var <- lazyeval::f_eval(var, dat)
  lvls <- plotly:::getLevels(var)
  dats <- lapply(seq_along(lvls), function(x) {
    cbind(dat[var %in% lvls[seq(1, x)], ], frame = lvls[[x]])
  })
  dplyr::bind_rows(dats)
}

df <- txhousing 
fig <- df %>%
  filter(year > 2005, city %in% c("Abilene", "Bay Area"))
fig <- fig %>% accumulate_by(~date)


fig <- fig %>%
  plot_ly(
    x = ~date, 
    y = ~median,
    split = ~city,
    frame = ~frame, 
    type = 'scatter',
    mode = 'lines', 
    line = list(simplyfy = F)
  )
fig <- fig %>% layout(
  xaxis = list(
    title = "Date",
    zeroline = F
  ),
  yaxis = list(
    title = "Median",
    zeroline = F
  )
) 
fig <- fig %>% animation_opts(
  frame = 100, 
  transition = 0, 
  redraw = FALSE
)
fig <- fig %>% animation_slider(
  hide = T
)
fig <- fig %>% animation_button(
  x = 1, xanchor = "right", y = 0, yanchor = "bottom"
)

fig
```

Other example of plotly

```{r, out.height=300, out.width=300}
library(plotly)
# volcano is a numeric matrix that ships with R
fig <- plot_ly(z = ~volcano)
fig <- fig %>% add_surface()

fig

```

## In Utero Vocal Learning

Last compiled: `r Sys.Date()`

Human Infants are born crying with an accent that reflects the pitch accent of the language of the environment in which they gestate.

This strand of research concerns itself with this from two perspectives:

1.  How does a fetus learn to implement an accent, despite having no opportunity to practice vocalisation *in utero*?
2.  Is there a benefit to a newborn of crying with a "native" accent?

In order to address these questions we are undertaking an SNF-funded investigation to examine the acoustic features of infants' cries that make them more or less aversive or salient to potential caregivers and the *in utero*Â cerebral processes that underpin acquisition of early precursors of human speech.
