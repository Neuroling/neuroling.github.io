### Goals

Every team-member has the right to regular meetings with their PI, which we aim to have weekly. In order to manage projects, goals are set regularly, and progress against these goals assessed once a month, or more frequently if desired. Goals and project-related decision making are documented in an appropriate form agreed with the PI (current [imperfect] solutions are MS OneNote and MS Planner). 

Goals should be: **SMART**

**S**pecific  
**M**easurable  
**A**greed  
**R**ealistic   
**T**ime-bound

### Initiative
Working together successfully requires effective communication and taking responsibility appropriate to your role. You must take initiative.

In research, we are frequently faced with problems. It is essential to approach them proactively and to handle them to the best of your own abilities. There are levels of initiativeâ€¦  

0. Say nothing - _never_ acceptable. 
1. Waiting to be asked - _never_ acceptable. 
2. Announce that there is a problem - acceptable only from junior team members. 
3. Suggest a solution - the absolute minimum. 
4. Solve the problem and immediately report - *aim at least here*. 
5. Solve the problem and report routinely - **where we should be**. 
6. Solve the problem and say nothing - _dangerous_ the PI needs to know about problems.

### Values ###

As a team, we set out core values for ourselves. These develop over time and should be reviewed as necessary. Compliance with legal and ethical obligations is non-negotiable.

**Collegiality -** skills and knowledge are shared. Respectful constructive criticism is welcome.

**Curiosity -** we are hungry for knowledge. We value learning outside our core interests, as we are conscious that this will drive inspiration and creativity.

**Empowerment -** we develop our skills in order to become maximally autonomous in making project-related decisions. We ask for help when we need it.

**Transparency -** design, code, analysis and data are documented with the goal of ensuring compliance with FAIR principles. We take ownership of mistakes and find solutions to rectify them. 

### Working Guidelines ### 
**Try to have fun, despite constraints**  

* **ANTICIPATION:** Do not request feedback that is to be turned around within less than 7 days.  
* **PROACTIVITY:** Report on projects regularly, even if unprompted. If I don't hear from you, I will assume there is no progress.  
* **Notification:** Request vacation. Ensure it is approved and entered into a lab calendar. Inform of absence due to illness.  
* **Core Hours:** Team members should be available 10h00-16h00 on their work days. Flexibility is granted _by agreement_ to accommodate caring responsibilities.  
* **Order:** Use a reference manager (UNIGE - you have access to Endnote for free; UZH - if you want Endnote, ask, otherwise JabRef, Zotero, Mendeley all exist). Maintain order in code and data at all times.   
* **Document:** Keep records of meetings and project decisions. Note your novel ideas.   
* **Identity:** There is a preferred lab graphical and visual style, all scientific communications (posters, talks) must at minimum bear the lab and host institution logos, and acknowledge funding sources. Acknowledge the contributions of colleagues and assistants.

Perfection is the enemy of the good. Aim to achieve the best you can. Next time will be even better.
