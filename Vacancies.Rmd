### **Post-Doctoral Position**: Neural Dynamics of Sentence Processing

The *neurolinguisitics* team at the *University of Zurich* is recruiting a post-doctoral researcher with expertise in M/EEG and an interest in the neural basis of speech and language to work on a four-year cross-linguistic multidisciplinary project examining multiple aspects of naturalistic speech processing and reading. The project involves close collaboration between neurolinguists ([Alexis Hervais-Adelman](https://neuroling.github.io/)), computational linguists ([Lena Jäger](https://www.cl.uzh.ch/en/digital-linguistics/people/group-leader/jaeger.html)) and linguists ([Marianne Hundt](https://www.linguistik.uzh.ch/en/about/mitglieder/hundt.html), [Fernando Zúñiga](https://www.isw.unibe.ch/ueber_uns/personen/prof_dr_ziga_fernando/index_ger.html)). 

The successful candidate will be responsible for the implementation of a series of investigations that examine the neural signatures of various combinatorial processes and combine computational linguistic approaches to semantic embedding spaces with temporally resolved brain recordings in order to elucidate the neural signatures of combinatorial meaning-building operations using MEG.  

**Person Specification:** 

You have a strong methodological background M/EEG, an interest in neurolinguistics and a passion for multidisciplinary research. You are able to communicate and collaborate productively with scholars of different disciplines. You are solution-oriented, well-organised and enjoy taking the lead. You share your expertise with other members of the team and actively contribute to project development. You have a desire to learn new techniques and determination to master complex analyses.  

**Requirements:** 

-   PhD in a relevant discipline (e.g. Cognitive neuroscience of language or a related field) 

-   Significant expertise in M/EEG, including data acquisition, preprocessing and advanced analysis  

-   Programming skills required for data analysis and experimental design (e.g. Psychtoolbox, PsychoPy, MNE-python, scikit-learn) 

<!-- -->

-   Excellent written and spoken English 

-   Experience supervising students (MSc./Ph.D.) and research assistants 

-    A proven record of publication of M/EEG experiments in peer-reviewed journals appropriate for the career stage 

Desirable 

-   Flexibility to travel for off-site data acquisition 

<!-- -->

-   Analysis of time-resolved imaging data using temporal response function  

-   Familiarity with multivariate analysis methods including decoding/encoding approaches 

**The Team** 

The Neurolinguistics group in the Department of Psychology at the University of Zurich investigates the neural basis of language using multimethodological approaches including M/EEG, fMRI and brain stimulation. In addition to affiliation in the Department of Psychology, the successful candidate will benefit from an inspiring multidisciplinary research environment thanks to close contact with the [NCCR Evolving Language](https://evolvinglanguage.ch/), the [Zurich Centre for Linguistics](https://www.linguistik.uzh.ch/de.html) and the [Zurich Centre for Neuroscience](https://www.neuroscience.uzh.ch/en.html).  

We offer an inspiring research environment in an enthusiastic team, and the possibility of developing your profile within the scope of the project at one of Europe's leading (LERU) universities in one of the top ten most livable cities world-wide. 

**Desired start date**: as soon as practicable, flexible for the appropriate candidate.  

For further details or informal inquiries, please contact: Prof. Dr. Alexis Hervais-Adelman, [alexis.hervais-adelman\@psychologie.uzh.ch](mailto:alexis.hervais-adelman@psychologie.uzh.ch) 

Applications, with the reference "DNL02",  including your CV, list of publications (if applicable), motivation letter, names of two referees as a single PDF file should be sent to [Sarah.Krause\@uzh.ch](mailto:Sarah.Krause@uzh.ch). Applications will be considered until the vacancy is filled.

### **Master Thesis:** Machine Learning, EEG Neurofeedback and degraded speech perception

Reduced speech comprehension due to hearing impairments which can have dramatic consequences for quality of life.

Our project aims at gaining fundamental knowledge on the neurocognitive basis of our ability to comprehend degraded speech in acoustically challenging situations. We will use *electroencephalography* (EEG) and *machine learning decoding* to investigate patterns of brain activity associated with better speech in noise comprehension.

The ultimate goal of this project is to define better targets for future neurofeedback.

 - We offer hands-on experience collecting high-quality electrophysiological data and applying advanced signal processing and analysis techniques.    

 - Number of theses on this project: 2-3

 - Starting date negotiable

### **Master Thesis:** Audio and video-driven features in audiovisual speech perception

The visual component of speech plays an important part in real-world communication, as evidenced by the literature, and by mask-wearing during the Covid19 pandemic. This audio-visual comprehension gain plays a yet greater role for those living with hearing impairment, a majority of the ageing population, so understanding the mechanisms which underpin audio-visual integration is important for the development of advanced hearing aids. Despite a concerted effort to this end over the past decades, several aspects of these processes remain unclear – not least with respect to the role of temporal and categorical cues carried by the visual component of speech. This project aims to disentangle these effects through a set of behavioural experiments on degraded audio-visual speech comprehension carried out online and in the lab. Findings will inform further studies with brain-imaging and contribute to the development of solutions for individuals who suffer from hearing impairment.
