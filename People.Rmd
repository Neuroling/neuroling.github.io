Alexis Hervais-Adelman is head of the Neurolinguistics Division at the Psychology Institute of the University of Zurich. His research uses several approaches to elucidate the brain networks of language, and interventions that might serve to train and improve them. His team deploys multiple neuroimaging and behavioural methods methods to investigate the brain networks of extreme language - be it the perception of acoustically challenging speech, or the challenges posed by multilingualism.

He began his academic career at the University of Cambridge, where he obtained his doctoral degree in cognitive neuroscience in 2008, for his thesis entitled "The perceptual learning of degraded speech". Subsequently he worked at the Centre for the Neural Basis of Hearing, Cambridge University Department of Physiology, investigating the representation of speech sounds in human auditory cortex. In 2009 he moved to the University of Geneva where he held positions in the Fundamental Neuroscience Department and the Department of Interpreting. There, he worked extensively on the neuroscience of simultaneous interpreting in order to reveal the brain networks that allow interpreters to carry out their highly challenging multilingual work and has examined the consequences of expertise in simultaneous interpretation for the brain. Subsequently, he became a member of research staff at the Neurobiology of Language group at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen. There he became involved in several projects investigating diverse aspects of the human language faculty.

```

Gorka Fraga González is a postdoctoral researcher with an interest in understanding brain function for different aspects of learning and development. Gorka received his PhD in 2016 at the University of Amsterdam (Developmental Psychology). His doctoral thesis "Fixing fluency: neurocognitive assessment of a dysfluent reading intervention" used electroencephalography (EEG) and a longitudinal design to study brain responses to words in children with and without dyslexia. He continued as a postdoc in the University of Amsterdam examining electrophysiological responses and EEG networks associated with feedback-based learning of novel symbol-speech sound associations. In 2018 he moved to the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, at the University of Zurich. He worked on several developmental EEG studies examining letter and number processing through kindergarten and elementary school. From 2020 to 2022 he led the project "Grapholemo: Grapheme-phoneme learning modelling", where he used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a computational model (reinforcement learning drift diffusion) to delineate the brain areas involved in symbol-speech sound learning.

```

My research interests lie within auditory cognitive-neuroscience, focusing on affective processing and auditory streaming, but also with an interest towards multi-modal processing. My work at University of Zurich is concerned with the perception of affective voices in noisy conditions, and the underlying neural correlates responsible for accurate perception and categorization.

### Enrico Varano

```

Enrico Varano is transitioning to a postdoctoral position in the Neurolinguistics Division of the Psychology Institute, University of Zurich, where he is investigating language processes using transcranial random noise stimulation.

Enrico's joined Imperial College London, Department of Bioengineering, in 2018 to pursue a PhD in Sensory Neuroscience. Employing electroencephalography (EEG) and a variety of visual signals, he focused on the brain's ability to integrate the audio and visual components of natural speech to overcome comprehension difficulties in noisy environments, and the neural mechanisms that underpin this skill. He also investigated how multimodal integration processes change with ageing and published a corpus of speech media specifically designed to enable reproducible and ecologically valid EEG studies in audiovisual speech comprehension and integration. By employing AI-generated talking head videos to improve speech-in-noise comprehension, he showed that findings in the field may be immediately applicable in the development of multimodal hearing prostheses. At Imperial College London, Enrico also worked with transcranial alternating current stimulation to investigate the neural processing of concurrent speakers.

Fun fact: Enrico's research career began at the University of Bristol, from which he received his Bachelor's degree in engineering in 2018, where he worked on nano-reinforced polymer composites.

Alejandra Hüsser is transitioning to a postdoctoral position in the Neurolinguistics lab. Her research interests are neurodevelopment, neuropathologies, functional brain networks and brain plasticity in children and adolescents. She has previously investigated cerebral language networks in paediatric patients with epilepsy in the LIONlab at the Université de Montréal. She conducted functional neuroimaging with electroencephalography (EEG) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and further has experience in neuropsychological assessments of children and adults both in clinical and scientific settings.

As a post-doctoral fellow Alejandra will focus on the early development of cerebral networksinvolved in speech production and specifically look into prenatal and neonatal brain dynamics of different key brain regions of language networks.

Her work aims to increase the understanding of the developmental trajectory of cerebral language processing, to enlighten how characteristics of the foetus' and infant's brain relates to language abilities and to better identify the alterations related to neuropathologies.

Sibylle Meier is currently pursuing a Master of Science in Psychology at the University of Zurich. During her studies, she focused on neuropsychology in addition to clinical psychology. Among other things, she dealt with a wide variety of methods to study structural and/or functional changes in the brain. During her six-month internship at the Lengg Clinic for inpatient neurorehabilitation, she also worked daily with patients whose cognitive functions were impaired by accident or disease. She would now like to deepen her theoretical knowledge as well as her practical experience in the field of neuropsychology through her master thesis by participating in  the research on the topic "Real-Time Neurofeedback for Enhancing Speech Comprehension in Noise". She is particularly interested in the used research methods such as electroencephalography (EEG) and the resulting possibilities for statistical data analysis.
