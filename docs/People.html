<h3>Prof. Dr. Alexis Hervais-Adelman (Group leader)</h3>
<div class="floatting">
<p><img src="images/Alexis.jpg" width="30%" style="float:left; padding:10px" /></p>
<p>Alexis Hervais-Adelman is head of the Neurolinguistics Team at the
Psychology Department of the University of Zurich where he worked
full-time from 2018 to 2023. He is now Assistant Professor and head of
the Dynamics of Language and the Brain Lab at the University of Geneva
and continues to work at the University of Zurich. His research uses
several approaches to elucidate the brain networks of language, and
interventions that might serve to train and improve them. His team
deploys multiple neuroimaging and behavioural methods methods to
investigate the brain networks of extreme language - be it the
perception of acoustically challenging speech, or the challenges posed
by multilingualism.</p>
<p>He began his academic career at the University of Cambridge, where he
obtained his doctoral degree in cognitive neuroscience in 2008, for his
thesis entitled “The perceptual learning of degraded speech”.
Subsequently he worked at the Centre for the Neural Basis of Hearing,
Cambridge University Department of Physiology, investigating the
representation of speech sounds in human auditory cortex. In 2009 he
moved to the University of Geneva where he held positions in the
Fundamental Neuroscience Department and the Department of Interpreting.
There, he worked extensively on the neuroscience of simultaneous
interpreting in order to reveal the brain networks that allow
interpreters to carry out their highly challenging multilingual work and
has examined the consequences of expertise in simultaneous
interpretation for the brain. Subsequently, he became a member of
research staff at the Neurobiology of Language group at the Max Planck
Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen. There he became involved in
several projects investigating diverse aspects of the human language
faculty.</p>

<p>Gorka Fraga González is a postdoctoral researcher with an interest in
understanding brain function for different aspects of learning and
development. Gorka received his PhD in 2016 at the University of
Amsterdam (Developmental Psychology). His doctoral thesis “Fixing
fluency: neurocognitive assessment of a dysfluent reading intervention”
used electroencephalography (EEG) and a longitudinal design to study
brain responses to words in children with and without dyslexia. He
continued as a postdoc in the University of Amsterdam examining
electrophysiological responses and EEG networks associated with
feedback-based learning of novel symbol-speech sound associations. In
2018 he moved to the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and
Psychotherapy, at the University of Zurich. He worked on several
developmental EEG studies examining letter and number processing through
kindergarten and elementary school. From 2020 to 2022 he led the project
“Grapholemo: Grapheme-phoneme learning modelling”, where he used
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a computational model
(reinforcement learning drift diffusion) to delineate the brain areas
involved in symbol-speech sound learning.</p>

<p>Enrico Varano is transitioning to a postdoctoral position in the
Neurolinguistics Division of the Psychology Institute, University of
Zurich, where he is investigating language processes using transcranial
random noise stimulation.</p>
<p>Enrico’s joined Imperial College London, Department of
Bioengineering, in 2018 to pursue a PhD in Sensory Neuroscience.
Employing electroencephalography (EEG) and a variety of visual signals,
he focused on the brain’s ability to integrate the audio and visual
components of natural speech to overcome comprehension difficulties in
noisy environments, and the neural mechanisms that underpin this skill.
He also investigated how multimodal integration processes change with
ageing and published a corpus of speech media specifically designed to
enable reproducible and ecologically valid EEG studies in audiovisual
speech comprehension and integration. By employing AI-generated talking
head videos to improve speech-in-noise comprehension, he showed that
findings in the field may be immediately applicable in the development
of multimodal hearing prostheses. At Imperial College London, Enrico
also worked with transcranial alternating current stimulation to
investigate the neural processing of concurrent speakers.</p>
<p>Fun fact: Enrico’s research career began at the University of
Bristol, from which he received his Bachelor’s degree in engineering in
2018, where he worked on nano-reinforced polymer composites.</p>

<p>As a post-doctoral fellow Alejandra will focus on the early
development of cerebral networksinvolved in speech production and
specifically look into prenatal and neonatal brain dynamics of different
key brain regions of language networks.</p>
<p>Her work aims to increase the understanding of the developmental
trajectory of cerebral language processing, to enlighten how
characteristics of the foetus’ and infant’s brain relates to language
abilities and to better identify the alterations related to

Natalia Bekemeier is a postdoctoral researcher at the Zurich Center for
Linguistics (LiZZ) of the University of Zurich. Her research interests
lie within the area of semantic and morphosyntactic processes underlying
language comprehension. Natalia received her PhD in Linguistics in 2016
at the University of Konstanz, Germany. Her doctoral thesis “On the
Representation and Processing of Phonological Stem Variants of Complex
Words” employed electroencephalography (EEG) in a series of
cross-linguistic studies ranging from single-word to sentence level
presentation. Upon receiving her PhD, Natalia joined the CRC 991 at the
Heinrich-Heine-University, Düsseldorf to investigate the structure of
representations in language, cognition, and science, where she conducted
several EEG, behavioral and eye-tracking studies focused on conceptual
knowledge, mass-count distinction, and determiner/quantifier processing.
In 2023, Natalia moved to the Zurich Center for Linguistics (LiZZ) of
the University of Zurich to work on the SNF-funded project “Prototypes
and Parts-of-Speech (ProPoS): A cross-linguistic, multi-methods approach
to categorization with a focus on Adjectives”. In this project, she uses
magnetoencephalography (MEG) to elucidate neurobiological correlates of
the core parts of speech, such as noun, verb and adjective, and to
investigate the contribution of part-of-speech information to the phrase
structure building in three typologically different languages: English,
Basque and Mandarin Chinese.</p>
