Master Thesis Opportunity!	" *Machine Learning, EEG Neurofeedback and Speech-in-Noise Comprehension*                   
 Reduced speech comprehension due to hearing impairments which can have dramatic consequences for quality of life.
 Our project aims at gaining fundamental knowledge on the neurocognitive basis of our ability to comprehend degraded speech in acoustically challenging situations. 
 We will use **electroencephalography** (EEG) and **machine learning** **decoding** to investigate patterns of brain activity associated with better speech in noise comprehension.
 The ultimate goal of this project is to define better targets for future neurofeedback.
